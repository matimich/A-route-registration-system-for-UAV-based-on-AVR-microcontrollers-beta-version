Description:
A route registration system for UAV, based on AVR microcontrollers is a platform consisting of three ATmega microcontrollers, GPS module and an MicroSD card drive. One of the aims of the project was to learn as much communication interfaces as possible, that is why the project includes UART, I2C, SPI, CAN interfaces. All code has been written in C language. To communicate with MicroSD card drive "FatFs" library has been used. In addition, to make communication with CAN, MCP2515 module and MCP2551 transciver have been used. Working with this components reqiured to attached additional elements from "" library into the project.
Because project was made mostly for a educational purposes, apart from 


The project was made as diploma thesis.
